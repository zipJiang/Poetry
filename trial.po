If they be two, they are two so
     As stiff twin compasses are two,
Thy soul the fixed foot, makes no show
     To move, but doth, as the other cease not to.

And though it in the centre sit,
     Yet when the other far doth roam,
It leans, and hearkens after it,
     And grows erect, as that comes home.

Such wilt thou be to me, who must
     Like thâ€™other foot, obliquely run;
Thy firmness and love divide my two circles just,
     By makes me with four ENDS then, where I begun.
